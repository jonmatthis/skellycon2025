# skellycon2025

We're gonna do like a SkellyCon Situation tentatively planned for **18-22 (M-F) August 2025**

On each day I will do a 2-3 hour livestream discussing the different parts of this project, including background, current status, and future plans. 

The first day will be an overview of the whole project, and the subsequent days will discuss the sub-skelly repos that handle the individual pieces
